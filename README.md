## Requirements
* Skyrim (either the original or Special Edition) installed on your PC
* A Nexus Mods account (free)
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or any archive extraction software
* Basic understanding of copying/moving files on Windows
* An internet connection

## Game Version Notes
There are two primary versions of Skyrim you'll likely run into:

### 1. Skyrim Legendary Edition (Oldrim)
* Released in 2011  
* 32-bit  
* Named "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" on Steam  
* Uses `Skyrim.exe`

### 2. Skyrim Special Edition (SSE) 
* Released in 2016  
* 64-bit  
* Improved performance, mod support  
* Named "Skyrim Special Edition" on Steam  
* Uses `SkyrimSE.exe`

Most modern mods target **Skyrim Special Edition**. Vortex can detect both versions automatically, but always make sure to download mods compatible with your specific version.

### If you're using a non-Steam version (e.g. GOG)  
Vortex and mod support work similarly, but youâ€™ll need to manually tell Vortex where your game is installed. Some mods or tools like SKSE may not fully support GOG versions.

## Backup Your Game Files!
Before modding Skyrim, it's highly recommended to **back up** your installation in case a mod breaks something.

You can do this by performing the following.

* Copying your entire Skyrim folder (`Skyrim` or `Skyrim Special Edition`) to another location on your drive.
* Backing up your save files:
    * Found in: `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\My Games\Skyrim\Saves`

This ensures you can restore from a backup if a mod causes issues.

## Install Vortex Mod Manager
[Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) is the recommended mod manager for Skyrim developed by [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim).

Here are steps to download, launch, and configure the tool.

1. Download Vortex from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files).
    * Unless if you're a premium user, you will need to choose the **slow download** option.
2. Run the installer.
    * **Windows**: Ensure you have [.NET Desktop Runtime 6](https://aka.ms/dotnet/6.0/windowsdesktop-runtime-win-x64.exe) installed!
    * Vortex may prompt and guide you on fixing issues.
3. Now go to the **Games**  tab.
4. Either find Skyrim from the **Unmanaged** list of games or search for it in the search box at the top.
5. Click the **Manage** button located in the middle of the Skyrim game card.
6. This will attempt to add support for the game.
    * If Vortex has issues finding the game's location, follow the below steps:
        1. Go to the **Games** tab through Vortex.
        2. Find the game card under the **Managed** list.
        3. Click the **three dots** button located to the top-right of the card.
        4. Click **Manually Set Location**.
        5. Select the location of your game install.
    * Ensure you see the game's section in the left sidebar. If not, click the **Activate** button under the game card.

Vortex should now be configured and installed for modding Skyrim!

## Where To Download Mods
The main source for Skyrim mods is [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim) or [Nexus Mods - SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition).

Other (less common) websites include the following.
* [LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/)
* [AFK Mods](https://www.afkmods.com/)
* [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim)

**NOTE** - Always read the mod description and user posts before installing any mod. Some mods have special requirements or installation instructions!

## Installing Mods Through Vortex
1. Ensure you're logged into your Nexus Mods account through Vortex.
    * You can click the **Login** button at the top-right of the application if not.
3. Go to the mod's page you want to install on Nexus Mods' website.
4. If Vortex is supported, you'll see a **Vortex** button next to the **Manual** button on the right side. Click this button.
    * If you don't see a Vortex button, it means the mod is **not supported** through Vortex and you'll need to **manually install** the mod (instructions included below).
5. Choose what download type you want (e.g., slow download).
6. The file should open in Vortex automatically and start downloading.
    * Go to the **Downloads** tab through Vortex to check the progress!
7. The mod should be automatically installed.
    * You can go to the **Mods** tab under the Skyrim section in the left sidebar to confirm if the mod is loaded.
    * You can remove mods by clicking the **Remove** button located on the right side of the mod item.

The mod should now be loaded the next time you launch Skyrim!

## Manual Mod Installation (Advanced)

While Vortex is recommended, you can manually install simple mods.

Here are the steps do so.

1. Download the mod manually from Nexus Mods.
2. Extract the archive with 7-Zip.
3. Copy contents to your Skyrim `Data` folder:
    * Usually found at: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim\Data`
4. Enable the plugin (`.esp` or `.esm`) using Skyrim's built-in launcher or a load order tool like LOOT.

**NOTE** - Always read the mod's installation notes. Some require more advanced steps or external scripts.

## LOOT (Load Order Optimization Tool)
There are some Skyrim mods that must be loaded in a specific order. Use [LOOT](https://loot.github.io/) to automatically sort the mod/plugin order which should help prevent potential issues.

Here are steps on how to download and use LOOT.

1. Download LOOT from [here](https://loot.github.io/).
2. Install and run LOOT.
3. Click the "Sort Plugins" button.
4. This should automatically sort the plugins.

**NOTE** - You can launch LOOT from within Vortex as well.

## Script Extenders (SKSE)
There are some Skyrim mods that require the **Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE or SKSE64)** to function.

Here are steps on how to download and use SKSE.

1. Download SKSE for your Skyrim version from [here](https://skse.silverlock.org/).

2. Extract the contents of the downloaded file.

3. Copy these files into your Skyrim folder.
    * `skse64_loader.exe`
    * `skse64_1_5_97.dll` (or whatever version you're using)
    * `skse64_steam_loader.dll`

4. Always run the game using `skse64_loader.exe` (**not** `SkyrimSE.exe`).

5. You can create a shortcut or add it to Vortex as a custom executable.

**NOTE** - If you update Skyrim via Steam, you may need to redownload SKSE to match the new version.

## Conclusion
By now, you should know how to do the following!

* Back up your game.
* Install and use Vortex.
* Download and install mods for Skyrim.
